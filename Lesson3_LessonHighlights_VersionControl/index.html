            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that saves every version of a file or set of files each time they're edited or modified so that you can go back and find specific versions later on. Using a VCS or Version Control System is basically used as a recovery tool if you accidentally mess something up or lose a file. You can get this for very little overhead. There are also three different types of version control systems: local, centralized, and distributed. Each type of version control system can be used for different reasons but they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Once you know what you want to do with your VCS then you can decide which type would be best for you. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system. This means that the clients don't just look at the latest version of a file. Instead, it fully mirrors the repository. So, if a server was collaborating with Git and it ends up dying, the respositories can be copied back to the server. The creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, and the linux community wanted to create their own DVCS system. They wanted the system to be high speed, have a simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. Git was created in 2005 and was able to achieve all these goals.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different then other version control systems because it thinks about its data differently. It thinks of its data more as mini snapshots of a file system. It's like a stream of snapshots of everytime a file has been changed. Also, basically every operation on Git is local. This makes production and load time alot faster since it doesn't have to search other networks. Another important thing about Git is that there are three different states your file can be in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means its in your local database, modified means you've changed a file but haven't committed it to your database, and staged means you've marked a changed file in its current version to go into your next committ snapshot. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two different methods you can use to create a Git repository. The first takes a project or directory that already exists and imports it into Git. The second copies a Git repository that already exist from another server. When tracking a project in Git you must initialize it first by going to the directory and typing 'git init'. This doesn't track anything in your repository though so you have to use some git add and git committ commands. When cloning an existing repository you would use the git clone command. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github Setup and Configuration</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">First things first, once you visit https://github.com/ you must setup a free user account or pay for one if needed. You choose a unique username then provide your email and password. Make sure it's an accessible email address because you'll be asked to verify your account. If you use SSH remotes then you'll need to configure a public key. You do this by going to Settings then SSH Keys. Click "Add an SSH key" then name it and paste your public key file into the text area and click "Add key". After this your SSH key should be successfully configured. </p>
